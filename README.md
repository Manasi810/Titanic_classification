Titanic Survival Prediction
This project is a machine learning classification task aimed at predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. Using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, the model classifies whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and more.

Project Overview
The Titanic classification project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to predict the survival of passengers. The goal is to experiment with different models, compare their performance, and choose the one that best fits the problem.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset available on Kaggle. It contains data on 891 passengers with features such as:

PassengerId: Unique identifier
Pclass: Passenger class (1, 2, or 3)
Name: Passenger name
Sex: Gender
Age: Age in years
SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Data Preprocessing
To handle missing data and prepare the dataset for machine learning models, several preprocessing steps were taken:

Imputation of missing values in the 'Age' and 'Embarked' columns.
Conversion of categorical features such as 'Sex' and 'Embarked' into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
Feature scaling for continuous variables.
Feature Engineering
Additional features were created to enhance the predictive power of the model, such as:

Title extraction from the 'Name' column to create a new feature.
Family size calculation by combining 'SibSp' and 'Parch' columns.
Binning the 'Age' and 'Fare' columns to reduce noise.
Model Selection
Several machine learning models were tested, including:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Cross-validation was used to select the best model based on accuracy and other performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.

Evaluation
The model performance was evaluated using:

Confusion Matrix
Accuracy Score
Precision, Recall, F1 Score
ROC-AUC Curve
How to Run
